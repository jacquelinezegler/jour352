<p>Today, it seems impossible to talk about food without talking about vegan and vegetarian options as well. From milk made from fruits and vegetables to meatless meat, animal free diets are becoming increasingly popular.</p>    

<p>“You can eat all the tofu, eggplant, and wood chips you want. You can put ketchup on it. You can do whatever the hell you want. But stop coming to my house, talking down to me, because I eat meat. I don’t want to hear it.”</p>

<p>In that 2017 clip, Steve Harvey is talking specifically to his three vegan children. But the sentiment rings true from many people. A meat-free lifestyle seems to offend meat-eaters, but the world is becoming more and more plant oriented.</p>

<p>College students' dietary choices are constantly under fire. As they experience their first bits of freedom - freedoms that include choosing all their meals and cooking for themselves – what factors go into those choices?</p>

<p>Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a vegan as someone who is a strict vegetarian and consumes no food that comes from animals. This is also expanded to include people who do not use animal products like leather.</p>

<p>The Vegan Society’s definition of veganism is a bit more grounded in philosophy:</p>    

<p>“Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose.”</p>

<ul>
<li>No food from animals.</li>
<li>No animal products.</li>
<li>No products tested on animals.</li>
<li>No activities where animals provide entertainment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Veganism’s rebel sister is vegetarianism. The main difference between the two is that vegetarians do, in fact, consume dairy products, eggs and honey.</p>

<p>It’s no secret that college students are some of the most socially aware citizens and are conscious decision makers. So it comes as no surprise that, according to The Economist, 25% of Americans between the ages of 25 and 34 identify as vegan or vegetarian.</p> 

<p>Sixty-five percent of student respondents from a 20-person UMD survey said they are omnivores – they’ll eat anything if given the choice.</p>

<p>But 48% of the surveyed said they identified as vegan or vegetarian. One student said they do vegan and vegetarian days and another said they try to limit the amount of red meat they eat.</p> 

<p>No matter how they self-identified, 57% of responders said they eat more vegetarian options in college and an even 50%      said they eat more vegan options in college.</p>

<p>Of note, the survey had these two data points as two separate questions so there is overlap.</p>

<p>A number of respondents cited religious reasons as to why they chose vegan or vegetarianism. The Christian season of Lent is upon us and in many sects that means no meat on Wednesdays, Fridays, or both.</p>

<p>In the time of Coronavirus, a bishop in New Jersey has told members of his diocese that because of suddenly increased sacrifices, Catholics are allowed to eat meat on Fridays during Lent.</p>
     
<p>Aside from religious reasons, other students cited their upbringing. One student said, “I was raised vegetarian as a child, so when given the option, I chose to stick with it because of the healthier lifestyle and ethical reasons.”</p>

<p>Another said, “I took AP environmental science and watched 'Conspiracy.' After learning how harmful the meat industry is, in particular red meat, I decided to see how long I could go without eating any meat besides fish. Almost 4 years later, still going strong.”</p>

<p>And another said, “I never developed much of a taste for meat, besides when I would eat chicken occasionally growing up, so it was pretty easy to decide not to eat meat into adulthood. Additionally, I don't really know how to cook meat and don't have much of an interest in learning how to.”</p>

<p>Many students also cited the ease of access to ingredients, especially if their parents are vegetarian.</p>

<p>Colleges are listening too. According to TakePart, the University of North Texas installed an all-vegan dining hall. That year, meal plan sales rose by 20 percent. At UMD, 251 North and South Campus dining halls both have exclusively vegan stations.</p> 

<p>The invention of meatless meat has companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods cooking up ways to give meat-lovers the flavors and textures they want without putting the strain on animals and the environment.</p>

<p>According to CNN, these brands demand stores place their products right beside animal meat, since it cooks and tastes the same. In an interview with CNN CEO of Impossible Foods, Pat Brown said, “We only care about meat eaters. It does nothing to advertise to a vegetarian.”</p>
     
<p>It seems everyone has different reasons for choosing to go meatless.</p> 

<ul>
<li>Environmental reasons</li>
<li>Ethical reasons</li>
<li>Religious reasons</li>
<li>Even, “no interest in learning how to cook meat” reasons.</li>
</ul>

<p>But one thing is certain, young people are leading the charge towards a future that contains less meat.</p>
     
<p>Steve Harvey, now in 2019, said, “I don’t knock it. I’ve been vegan now, it’s going on a month. No, really. I started, a little bit more than a month now actually. I started on January 4. I’ve been a vegan ever since. I’m not going to stay no damn vegan. I’m just doing it to give my digestive system a break.”</p>
